"""
    This recipe replicates the first experiment proposed in the YourTTS paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02418).
    YourTTS model is based on the VITS model however it uses external speaker embeddings extracted from a pre-trained speaker encoder and has small architecture changes.
    In addition, YourTTS can be trained in multilingual data, however, this recipe replicates the single language training using the VCTK dataset.
    The VitsArgs instance has commented parameters used to enable the multilingual training.
